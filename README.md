# Components registry

The Wowza Flowplayer component registry is a public repository that allows for flexibility and modularity when customizing the player's user interface (UI). With this resource, developers can swap UI components with core player elements while meeting more diverse use cases. In turn, the solutions we provide in the component registry can help to promote user engagement and attract a wider audience.
